Code and de-identified data associated with the randomised trial to characterise the antibody response to salivary peptides following controlled human exposure to Southeast Asian mosquito vectors.

This repository stores the code and data associated with the manuscript entitled "Assessment of antibody responses to Anopheles SG6-P1 and Aedes N-term 34kDa salivary peptides: a human-challenge trial of controlled exposures to vector bites."

Of note: We have removed any identifiable data from the dataset (including age, sex, date of visit, etc.) in order to comply with ethics regulations. As models in the manuscript adjusted for age and sex, please note that final reported values may differ slightly.

All analysis was performed with STATA 18.0
